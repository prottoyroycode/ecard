In&#10; this Agreement, &#8220;<strong>You</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>your</strong>&#8221; means the person who has received and is authorized to use the Virtual Account. &#8220;<strong>We</strong>,&#8221; &#8220;<strong>us</strong>,&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>our</strong>&#8221; mean collectively MetaBank, N.A., a federally-chartered savings bank, Member FDIC, and its divisions or assignees. <strong>&#8220;Corporate Sponsor</strong>&#8221;&#10; means the company who has directly or indirectly established this &#10;Virtual Account for the purpose of disbursing funds to you. The Virtual &#10;Account may be canceled or revoked at any time without prior notice, &#10;subject to applicable law. Please read this Agreement carefully and keep&#10; it for future reference.</p><ol><li><strong> ABOUT YOUR VIRTUAL ACCOUNT</strong></li></ol><p>Your&#10; Virtual Account is a prepaid Virtual Account loaded by the Corporate &#10;Sponsor, redeemable to buy goods and services anywhere Visa debit &#10;Virtual Accounts are accepted, as described in the Virtual Account Use &#10;and Fees section. The Virtual Account is NOT a credit card. The Virtual &#10;Account is not a</p><p>checking account or connected in any way to any &#10;account other than a stored value account where your funds are held. The&#10; expiration date of the Virtual Account and the Virtual Account funds is&#10; identified on the Virtual Account. The funds on your Virtual Account &#10;will not be insured to you by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation &#10;(&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). <strong>2. USING YOUR VIRTUAL ACCOUNT</strong></p><ol><li><strong> Accessing Funds and Limitations</strong></li></ol><p>The&#10; Corporate Sponsor is fully responsible for ensuring funds are available&#10; to be loaded to your Virtual Account. Each time you use your Virtual &#10;Account, you authorize us to reduce the value available on your Virtual &#10;Account by the amount of the transaction. Your Virtual Account cannot be&#10; used for illegal transactions or used for purchases where recurring &#10;payments may occur, such as subscriptions, memberships, rentals, etc. &#10;For other card usage restrictions, please refer to the Virtual Account &#10;Use and Fees section of this Cardholder Agreement For security reasons, &#10;we may limit the amount or number of transactions you can make on your &#10;Virtual Account. We may refuse to process any transaction that we &#10;believe may violate the terms of this Agreement. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO &#10;EXCEED THE BALANCE OF THE FUNDS AVAILABLE ON YOUR VIRTUAL ACCOUNT. If &#10;you attempt to use the Virtual Account when there are insufficient funds&#10; associated with it, the transaction will generally be declined. &#10;Nevertheless, if a transaction that exceeds the balance of the funds &#10;available on your Virtual Account occurs due to a systems malfunction or&#10; otherwise, you will remain fully liable to us for the amount of the &#10;transaction. We reserve the right to cancel this Virtual Account should &#10;you create a negative balance. If you do not have enough funds available&#10; on your Virtual Account, you may be able to instruct the merchant &#10;perform a &#8220;split transaction&#8221; to charge part of the purchase to the &#10;Virtual Account and pay the remaining amount with another form of &#10;payment. <strong>b.&#160; Authorized Users</strong></p><p>If you allow &#10;another person to use the Virtual Account, you will be responsible under&#10; this Agreement for all transactions made by that person, regardless of &#10;whether you intended to be responsible for all of them, as well as all &#10;associated fees and charges, even if any of those transactions, fees or &#10;charges caused your balance to go negative.</p><ol><li><strong>Personal Identification&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Number&#160;&#160; (PIN)</strong></li></ol><p>You&#10; will not receive a Personalized Identification Number (&#8220;PIN&#8221;). However,&#10; when you first use the Virtual Account at a merchant&#8217;s Point of Sale &#10;(&#8216;POS&#8221;) device, any 4-digit code will work as the initial PIN for your &#10;first PIN-based transaction. After the first PIN-based transaction, you &#10;must use the same PIN for each subsequent PIN-based transaction, unless &#10;and until you choose to reset the PIN. You have the option to deactivate&#10; and reset the current PIN by visiting YourRewardCard.com or by calling &#10;customer service at 1-833-634-3155. You will be required to provide &#10;information about the Virtual Account (Virtual Account number, &#10;expiration date, and security code) prior to resetting the PIN. Once the&#10; PIN has been reset, you will then be able to select a new 4-digit PIN &#10;during your next PIN-based transaction at a merchant&#8217;s POS device. You &#10;should not write or keep your PIN with your Virtual Account. Never share&#10; your PIN with anyone and do not enter your PIN into any terminal that &#10;appears to be modified or suspicious.</p><ol><li><strong>Obtaining Virtual Account Balance Information</strong></li></ol><p>You&#10; may obtain information about the amount of money you have remaining on &#10;your Virtual Account at no charge by contacting Customer Service. This &#10;information, along with a history of Virtual Account transactions, is &#10;also available online by visiting our Website. It may also be possible &#10;to request a written copy of Virtual Account transactions by contacting &#10;Customer Service. <strong>e. Authorization Holds</strong></p><p>You do &#10;not have the right to stop payment on any purchase transaction &#10;originated by use of your Virtual Account. With certain types of &#10;purchases (such as those made at restaurants, hotels, or similar &#10;purchases), your Virtual Account may be &#8220;preauthorized&#8221; for an amount &#10;greater than the transaction amount to cover gratuity or incidental &#10;expenses. Any preauthorization amount will place a &#8220;hold&#8221; on your &#10;available funds until the merchant sends us the final payment amount of &#10;your purchase. Once the final payment amount is received, the &#10;preauthorization amount on hold will be removed. During this time, you &#10;will not have access to preauthorized amounts. If you authorize a &#10;transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, &#10;the approval may result in a hold for that amount of funds. <strong>f.&#160; Returns and Refunds</strong></p><p>If&#10; you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services &#10;obtained with your Virtual Account, the return and refund will be &#10;handled by the merchant. If the merchant credits your Virtual Account, &#10;the credit may not be immediately available. While merchant refunds post&#10; as soon as they are received, please note that we have no control over &#10;when a merchant sends a credit transaction and the refund may not be &#10;available for a number of days after the date the refund transaction &#10;occurs. <strong>g.

Description of Openbucks Service for Obucks Cards</p>&#10;&#9;&#9;  <p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">1) The Obucks Card redemption service enables you to use Obucks cards (each, an &#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Obucks Card</span>&#8221;) to purchase from Openbucks prepaid access issued by certain online merchants in the Openbucks network (&#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Openbucks Merchants</span>&#8221;),&#10; and to redeem that prepaid access with the Openbucks Merchant for goods&#10; and services sold by the corresponding Openbucks Merchant.   Obucks &#10;Card may be purchased from an authorized online Obucks distributor.</p>&#10;&#9;&#9;  <p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">2) A current list of authorized online Obucks Card distributors is available <a href=\\\"https://www.openbucks.com/support/customers.html#Obucks\\\" class=\\\"text-blue text-blue-hover\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> here </a>(each, a &#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Distributor</span>&#8221;).  <span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">For questions regarding your Obucks Card please contact the Distributor from whom you purchased your Obucks Card. </span> </p>&#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">3) Obucks Cards are issued by Openbucks and &#10;are redeemable only with Openbucks.  By entering your Obucks Card &#10;information and clicking &#8220;Pay&#8221; within the Obucks mini-digital store, you&#10; authorize Openbucks to redeem your Obucks Card to pay for prepaid &#10;access redeemable at the Openbucks Merchant you have selected.</p>&#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">4) You also authorize Openbucks to process &#10;the redemption of your Obucks Card and to debit the amount of your &#10;redemption from the balance of the Obucks Card, and you authorize the &#10;Openbucks Merchant to redeem the prepaid access you purchased to pay for&#10; the goods and services you have selected.  You agree that, if your &#10;Obucks Card redemption requires a currency conversion, for every &#10;currency conversion, we will apply the average daily interbank market &#10;rate published by a third-party foreign currency data provider &#10;(Reuters).  We will not charge a fee for currency conversions.</p>&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">&#9;&#9;  &#10;Please note: The Openbucks Service does not accept all prepaid cards. &#10;Here are a few examples of cards that are NOT accepted by the Openbucks &#10;Service:&#10;&#10;</p><ol>&#10;&#9;<li>- Any form of digital cards (a.k.a. e-gift cards) except for Obucks Cards;</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased online, even from an authorized distributor (except for Obucks Cards)</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased from a secondary marketplace</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased or traded on a peer-to-peer platform</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards traded with you in exchange for good or services or any other consideration</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards given to you by friends or relatives living in a different country</li>&#10;</ol>&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;<p></p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Expiration Dates.</span>  Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants never expire.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Fees Apply.</span> The Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants are not subject to fees.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Lost or Stolen Obucks Cards.</span>&#10;  Lost or stolen Obucks Cards will not be replaced.

You agree that, if your &#10;Obucks Card redemption requires a currency conversion, for every &#10;currency conversion, we will apply the average daily interbank market &#10;rate published by a third-party foreign currency data provider &#10;(Reuters).  We will not charge a fee for currency conversions.</p>&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">&#9;&#9;  &#10;Please note: The Openbucks Service does not accept all prepaid cards. &#10;Here are a few examples of cards that are NOT accepted by the Openbucks &#10;Service:&#10;&#10;</p><ol>&#10;&#9;<li>- Any form of digital cards (a.k.a. e-gift cards) except for Obucks Cards;</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased online, even from an authorized distributor (except for Obucks Cards)</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased from a secondary marketplace</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased or traded on a peer-to-peer platform</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards traded with you in exchange for good or services or any other consideration</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards given to you by friends or relatives living in a different country</li>&#10;</ol>&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;<p></p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Expiration Dates.</span>  Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants never expire.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Fees Apply.</span> The Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants are not subject to fees.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Lost or Stolen Obucks Cards.</span>&#10;  Lost or stolen Obucks Cards will not be replaced.

Description of Openbucks Service for Obucks Cards</p>&#10;&#9;&#9;  <p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">1) The Obucks Card redemption service enables you to use Obucks cards (each, an &#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Obucks Card</span>&#8221;) to purchase from Openbucks prepaid access issued by certain online merchants in the Openbucks network (&#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Openbucks Merchants</span>&#8221;),&#10; and to redeem that prepaid access with the Openbucks Merchant for goods&#10; and services sold by the corresponding Openbucks Merchant.   Obucks &#10;Card may be purchased from an authorized online Obucks distributor.</p>&#10;&#9;&#9;  <p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">2) A current list of authorized online Obucks Card distributors is available <a href=\\\"https://www.openbucks.com/support/customers.html#Obucks\\\" class=\\\"text-blue text-blue-hover\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> here </a>(each, a &#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Distributor</span>&#8221;).  <span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">For questions regarding your Obucks Card please contact the Distributor from whom you purchased your Obucks Card. </span> </p>&#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">3) Obucks Cards are issued by Openbucks and &#10;are redeemable only with Openbucks.  By entering your Obucks Card &#10;information and clicking &#8220;Pay&#8221; within the Obucks mini-digital store, you&#10; authorize Openbucks to redeem your Obucks Card to pay for prepaid &#10;access redeemable at the Openbucks Merchant you have selected.</p>&#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">4) You also authorize Openbucks to process &#10;the redemption of your Obucks Card and to debit the amount of your &#10;redemption from the balance of the Obucks Card, and you authorize the &#10;Openbucks Merchant to redeem the prepaid access you purchased to pay for&#10; the goods and services you have selected.  You agree that, if your &#10;Obucks Card redemption requires a currency conversion, for every &#10;currency conversion, we will apply the average daily interbank market &#10;rate published by a third-party foreign currency data provider &#10;(Reuters).  We will not charge a fee for currency conversions.</p>&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">&#9;&#9;  &#10;Please note: The Openbucks Service does not accept all prepaid cards. &#10;Here are a few examples of cards that are NOT accepted by the Openbucks &#10;Service:&#10;&#10;</p><ol>&#10;&#9;<li>- Any form of digital cards (a.k.a. e-gift cards) except for Obucks Cards;</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased online, even from an authorized distributor (except for Obucks Cards)</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased from a secondary marketplace</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased or traded on a peer-to-peer platform</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards traded with you in exchange for good or services or any other consideration</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards given to you by friends or relatives living in a different country</li>&#10;</ol>&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;<p></p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Expiration Dates.</span>  Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants never expire.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Fees Apply.</span> The Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants are not subject to fees.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Lost or Stolen Obucks Cards.</span>&#10;  Lost or stolen Obucks Cards will not be replaced.

Obucks &#10;Card may be purchased from an authorized online Obucks distributor.</p>&#10;&#9;&#9;  <p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">2) A current list of authorized online Obucks Card distributors is available <a href=\\\"https://www.openbucks.com/support/customers.html#Obucks\\\" class=\\\"text-blue text-blue-hover\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> here </a>(each, a &#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Distributor</span>&#8221;).  <span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">For questions regarding your Obucks Card please contact the Distributor from whom you purchased your Obucks Card. </span> </p>&#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">3) Obucks Cards are issued by Openbucks and &#10;are redeemable only with Openbucks.

You agree that, if your &#10;Obucks Card redemption requires a currency conversion, for every &#10;currency conversion, we will apply the average daily interbank market &#10;rate published by a third-party foreign currency data provider &#10;(Reuters).  We will not charge a fee for currency conversions.</p>&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">&#9;&#9;  &#10;Please note: The Openbucks Service does not accept all prepaid cards. &#10;Here are a few examples of cards that are NOT accepted by the Openbucks &#10;Service:&#10;&#10;</p><ol>&#10;&#9;<li>- Any form of digital cards (a.k.a. e-gift cards) except for Obucks Cards;</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased online, even from an authorized distributor (except for Obucks Cards)</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased from a secondary marketplace</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased or traded on a peer-to-peer platform</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards traded with you in exchange for good or services or any other consideration</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards given to you by friends or relatives living in a different country</li>&#10;</ol>&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;<p></p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Expiration Dates.</span>  Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants never expire.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Fees Apply.</span> The Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants are not subject to fees.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Lost or Stolen Obucks Cards.</span>&#10;  Lost or stolen Obucks Cards will not be replaced.

Description of Openbucks Service for Obucks Cards</p>&#10;&#9;&#9;  <p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">1) The Obucks Card redemption service enables you to use Obucks cards (each, an &#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Obucks Card</span>&#8221;) to purchase from Openbucks prepaid access issued by certain online merchants in the Openbucks network (&#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Openbucks Merchants</span>&#8221;),&#10; and to redeem that prepaid access with the Openbucks Merchant for goods&#10; and services sold by the corresponding Openbucks Merchant.   Obucks &#10;Card may be purchased from an authorized online Obucks distributor.</p>&#10;&#9;&#9;  <p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">2) A current list of authorized online Obucks Card distributors is available <a href=\\\"https://www.openbucks.com/support/customers.html#Obucks\\\" class=\\\"text-blue text-blue-hover\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> here </a>(each, a &#8220;<span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Distributor</span>&#8221;).  <span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">For questions regarding your Obucks Card please contact the Distributor from whom you purchased your Obucks Card. </span> </p>&#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">3) Obucks Cards are issued by Openbucks and &#10;are redeemable only with Openbucks.  By entering your Obucks Card &#10;information and clicking &#8220;Pay&#8221; within the Obucks mini-digital store, you&#10; authorize Openbucks to redeem your Obucks Card to pay for prepaid &#10;access redeemable at the Openbucks Merchant you have selected.</p>&#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">4) You also authorize Openbucks to process &#10;the redemption of your Obucks Card and to debit the amount of your &#10;redemption from the balance of the Obucks Card, and you authorize the &#10;Openbucks Merchant to redeem the prepaid access you purchased to pay for&#10; the goods and services you have selected.  You agree that, if your &#10;Obucks Card redemption requires a currency conversion, for every &#10;currency conversion, we will apply the average daily interbank market &#10;rate published by a third-party foreign currency data provider &#10;(Reuters).  We will not charge a fee for currency conversions.</p>&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;&#9;&#9;  &#10;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\">&#9;&#9;  &#10;Please note: The Openbucks Service does not accept all prepaid cards. &#10;Here are a few examples of cards that are NOT accepted by the Openbucks &#10;Service:&#10;&#10;</p><ol>&#10;&#9;<li>- Any form of digital cards (a.k.a. e-gift cards) except for Obucks Cards;</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased online, even from an authorized distributor (except for Obucks Cards)</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased from a secondary marketplace</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards purchased or traded on a peer-to-peer platform</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards traded with you in exchange for good or services or any other consideration</li>&#10;&#9;<li>- Cards given to you by friends or relatives living in a different country</li>&#10;</ol>&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;<p></p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Expiration Dates.</span>  Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants never expire.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">No Fees Apply.</span> The Obucks Cards and prepaid access products issued by Openbucks Merchants are not subject to fees.</p>&#9;&#10;&#9;&#10;&#9;<p class=\\\"padding-10px-tb\\\"><span class=\\\"font-weight-600\\\">Lost or Stolen Obucks Cards.</span>&#10;  Lost or stolen Obucks Cards will not be replaced.
